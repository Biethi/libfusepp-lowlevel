This is a C++ interface to the low level API from the [fuse library](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/releases/tag/fuse-2.9.7). The implementation is inspired from the [fusepp](https://github.com/jachappell/Fusepp) interface for the high level API.

The HelloFS example is taken with small modifications from the [example](https://github.com/jachappell/Fusepp/tree/master/example) of the fusepp interface.
